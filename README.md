# capstone
ML project
This is the CSC 690 course, capstore project required by the MSCS program.
It is designed to be done by only one student, and periodic report to the professor is also mandatory.
If students fail in the capstone project, they will not qualify for graduation in the very semester when they take the CSC690 course.
